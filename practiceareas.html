            Land laws in Kenya have evolved overtime from the received colonial
            laws that provided over Five (5) different registration regimes to
            self-contained and integrated laws a er the 2010 Constitution. While
            the objective was to harmonize all land laws under one regime, the
            ensuing transition has not been a smooth one as expected. <br />
            Several practical legal con icts still loom large and this has been
            the cause of a lot of uncertainity and, inevitably, con ict on among
